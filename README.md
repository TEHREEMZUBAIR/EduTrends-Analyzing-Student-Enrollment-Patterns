# 📊 EduTrends: Analyzing Student Enrollment Patterns

Welcome to **EduTrends**, a comprehensive data analysis project designed to study student enrollment trends in various departments and across different course types (online and classroom). This project covers data from 2011 to 2022 and provides valuable insights into how the format and department of a course impact student enrollment choices.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**EduTrends** investigates the following aspects:
- How do student enrollments vary between online and classroom courses?
- What are the department-specific trends in course offerings and enrollments?
- How have student enrollments changed over time from 2011 to 2022?

By leveraging Python-based data analysis tools and libraries, this project visualizes these patterns and offers key insights into how universities can optimize course offerings to better cater to student preferences.

## 📊 Data Analysis <a name="data-analysis"></a>

The analysis covers:
- **Course Type Distribution**: Visualizing how courses are divided between online and classroom formats across departments.
- **Enrollment Trends by Year**: Analyzing the trend in student enrollments from 2011 to 2022.
- **Department-Specific Insights**: Understanding how different departments (Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Science) impact course selection.
  
Data processing, visualization, and analysis were done using libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

---

## 📈 Results <a name="results"></a>

From the analysis, we found:

- **Technology & Mathematics**: More courses are offered online, leading to higher online enrollment.
- **Engineering & Science**: Most courses are offered on-campus, which explains the higher classroom enrollment in these departments.
- **Trend Over Time**: The trend shows a steady increase in online course enrollments over the years, especially in departments like Technology and Mathematics.

---

## 🏆 Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

The key takeaways from this study are:
- Universities are offering more online courses in departments like Technology and Mathematics, which explains the higher enrollment in online classes.
- Departments like Science and Engineering have more on-campus courses, leading to higher classroom enrollments.
- Over the years, the student preference for online courses has increased, but classroom courses still dominate in specific departments.

---

## 🔮 Future Work <a name="future-work"></a>

- Expanding the analysis to include more recent data (post-2022).
- Investigating the effect of external factors (e.g., pandemic) on course enrollment.
- Implementing machine learning models to predict future enrollment trends based on historical data.
